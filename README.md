# Robot prototype manufacture and troubleshoot

## 📌 Overview
This was a group project which simulated a warman competition. We worked in groups of 4 and had to complete tasks set out by the lecturers and the tutors. We had to design, build and troubleshoot the robot prototype on our own. 

## 🎯 Objectives
- Make a working robot
- Robot prototype has to pick up and contain 2 balls at different heights
- Robot prototype must drop balls into a hole


## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Inventor
- Arduino
- Soldering
- Laer cutting
- wiring and Electronics knowledge
- Detailed designing

## 🔍 Methodology
Our individual tasks were to come up with multiple design concepts with notes and details on how they could be manufactured using 3D modelling. Our group decided to implement 2 different ideas to make one working tobot. Our idea was having a robot with one arm to pick up the balls, and for the robot to hold the balls within the body. It would hold the balls until it reached the hole and then drop it off and get us the full points. 

In our teams, we split the workload. For the first protorype, my roles were : <br>
- 3D modelling assistance
- Laser cutting
- Manufacturing

For the second prototype, my roles were : <br>
- Soldering
- Wiring and organisation of wires
- troubleshooting

My roles changed as we realised where our groups strengths were after the first prorotype. To have more inclusion, we changed the roles.

- Any differences between expected and actual results

### Prototype 1
Prototype 1 did not go well. We overestimated the capabilities of the design and the materials we used. The prototype failed both the objectives and our class rubrics. The main reasons prototype 1 failed were : <br>
- Improper design of components
- Messy wiring techniques
- Weak solder joints
- Insufficient planning of potential issues

The components which failed badly were the wheels, the arm, and the back door. The wheels did nnot have enough traction to move forward, as they were too big and the O-rings could not be attached as per original design intended. The wheels were made bigger for the back door to function, but that resulted in a failure of the wheels. With smaller wheels, the mechanism for the back door was too large and raise the prototype off the ground. The arm holding the ball could not be raised with the initial plan of one servo. However, the claw mechanism did open and close well. However, the claw was too large and the ball fell through.  Considering that none of our group members had worked with electronics components, this was a huge learning curve and a turning point for designing the second prototype. 

### Prototype 2
Our team also had an imbalance in work load split in the first prototype due to different strengths and weaknesses. Before starting the second prototype, we discussed and shanged the roles to ensure a better outcome this time. Withthese changes, the protoype worked, but not perfectly. The main reasons prototype 2 failed were: <br>

- broken components
- battery drainage
- time constraints

The second prototype worked in the end. But it did not get the full points. The design and manufacturing differences of the second prototype were:<br> 
- omni wheels for better maneuverability
- prototype body to DC motors in a stable manner
- wider bottom panel to house all electronic components comfortably
- removed backdoor so ball gets held in claw and passively rolls down robot back
- redesign of claw to grip ball efficiently
- better understanding of DC motors, Servos, voltage regulators, so we know how to use them for better results
- shorter arm length for less bending forces acting on the servo
- 2 servos used to lift arm up with ball
- new and improved attachments on electronic components onto bottom board.
- Better accessibility, labelling and organisation of wires
- batery pack easily removable and switch implemented.
- SONAR included for accurate stoppage of prototype to a certain distance

These updated designs and manufacturing differences immensely helped with the build quality and the trouble shooting of the protoype. With the implementation of new panel designs, this made the electronics of the protorype to be assembled and troubleshooted easily. However, even with all these upgrades, some components still failed and had to be swapped or changed close to the deadline, which resulted in less time for testing. Furthermore, on the day of our grading, we realised that the arm could not hold the ball in a static position, which resulted in our core idea of the prototype functionality to be a failure. Regardless, my team mate in charge of the arduino code managed to code up a run which worked in a make shift template of the test setup. We managed to get one of the balls into the hole, which as a team we were pleased with.

## 📚 What I Learned
- Communication with team and understaning our strengths and weknesses early on is important
- Working with electronic components and soldering and wiring is tricky but rewarding
- Designing for manufacturing require time and planning ahead
- Make the design simple but functional to reduce difficulties in manufacturing and troubleshooting
- Learnt from my peers on how to imrpove my report writing and different ways to convey ideas
- For the future, I know to ask more questions and not be afraid to experiment with parts.
